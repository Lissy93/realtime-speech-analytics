### Intro 

This is a simple node app, which listens for speach (of any type), and in realtime calculates insightful 
stats from it, then generates a series of visual analytics in D3.js, which are updated live, as speach
comes in.

This includes, current sentiment, most commonly used words, pace of speach, key entities that are being mentioned, and more.
The technology developed can be put into use in areas, such as speach coaching, meeting notes, inteligent subtitles, learning languages, live news analysis, gauging consumer feedback on review videos, sports commentry etc...

_Initially developed as a prototype, by myself (Alicia Sykes), and Oliver Poole (in 24 hours!) during AngelHack London 2016._
